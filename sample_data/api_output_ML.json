    "summary": "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that develops statistical algorithms capable of learning from data and generalizing to new situations without explicit instructions. It relies on foundations of statistics and mathematical optimization, encompassing types such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The field has evolved from early neural models and checkers programs in the 1950s to advanced deep learning techniques like GANs and AlphaGo.",
