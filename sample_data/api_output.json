    "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. These machines can perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. The field has evolved from simple rule-based systems to complex neural networks and generative models.",
